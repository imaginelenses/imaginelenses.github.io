Hello, I'm **Karthik Shivashankar**, and Imaginelenses is my personal brand. <a href="mailto:imaginelenses@gmail.com">Send me an email</a>.

### {% title "Why Imaginelenses?" %}
Today's pop culture may suggest it's inspired by {% link "https://open.spotify.com/artist/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q", "Imagine Dragons" %} but, no, it's inspired by {% link "https://open.spotify.com/track/7pKfPomDEeI4TPT6EOYjn9?si=7cde9c24572340e9", "John Lennon" %}. Deep down we all are mere dreamers and the world we imagine isn't quite what it is. So let's imaginelenses through which we see the world the way we dreamt it to be!

### {% title "About Me" %}
A few years ago, I took {% link "https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/", "CS50"%} by {% link "https://twitter.com/davidjmalan", "David Malan"%} at Harvard and I fell in love with Computer Science. Ever since I've taught myself Computer Science holistically and have worked on many <a href="/projects">projects</a> of my own.

I've been clicking <a href="/photo">pictures</a> from a pretty young age. For many years I shot on Point-and-Shoots and my Phone. Only a few years ago did I get my first Interchangeable Lens Camera, <a href="https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit" target="_blank">Sony Î±6000</a>. I take full advantage of the digital format by clicking as many pictures as required until I get the shot in my head.

On a more personal note, I love traveling and exploring new places and cultures. I love listening stories and I try to tell one in every image I create. I want to meet as many people as possible in life, listen to their stories and get to know as many of them as possible - I believe there is something to learn from each one of them.
  
I also love going on adventures like hiking, trekking, rock climbing, river rafting and zip-lining; skydiving and much more is on my long bucket list.
