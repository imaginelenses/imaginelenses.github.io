The Enigma machine is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography" target="_blank">cryptographic device</a> developed and used in the early-to-mid 20th century by Nazi Germany during World War II. The Enigma machine was considered impossible to crack the code that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages.

However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>, the father of theoretical computer science and AI, built a machine to crack the code. The British kept this a secret for nearly 30 years after the war. There is a great movie about the entire story called <em>The Imitation Game</em>.
