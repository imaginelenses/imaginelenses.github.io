A version control software gives you the ability to store all versions of your file in a single place and not worry about filenames and origanisation. Think of it like having just one file stand to store all versions of your file!

Version control has been standard practice in software development to keep track of changes to code for years now. However, when it comes to working with files other than textual files you usually out of luck.

OneProjectFile aims to bring basic version control functionality to a wide range of filetypes. And this is achieved by storing all the files in the user's Google Drive.
